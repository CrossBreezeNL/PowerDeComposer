# Cucumber Top Tip:
# When you use a Doc String: """ in cucumber then the amount of whitespace before the """ is removed from the subsequent lines of the docstring.
# For example when there are 2 spaces before """ then the next lines the maximum of 2 spaces or tabs are removed.
# So make sure the whitespace type used across the lines are equal.
